Their model is composed by 3 layers of 256 LSTM units. The output of the last layer is feed into a fully connected layer with 128 units with sigmoid activations. That fully connected layer is followed by another layer of the same type with 72 output units. The ouputs of that previous layer are used as the weights and parameters of the output of a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**."
